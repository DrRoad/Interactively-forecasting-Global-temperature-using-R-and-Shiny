# Interactively-forecasting-Global-temperature-using-R-and-Shiny
This work is a extensive interactive visualization as well as forecasting tool to forecast global monthly temperature. Choice of country and state (for which the forecasting is required) is menu driven and based upon dynamic subsetting of data. In addition, various graphs and parameters pertaining to the model builiding, comparison of predicted and actual values and future forecast are all based upon click of the reelvant action buttons. The time series algorithm used is Exponential Smoothing, and fairly good results are obtained for a large combinations of countries and states.
